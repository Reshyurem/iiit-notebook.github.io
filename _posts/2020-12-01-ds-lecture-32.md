## Polynomials over Rings
#### Theorem.
A polynomial $p(x)$ is irreducible over a field $K$ iff $kp(x)$ is also irreducible over $K$, where $k \in K$.  
**Proof.** We will prove both directions.  
(i) $p(x)$ is irreducible over $K \Rightarrow kp(x)$ is irreducible over $K$.  
Suppose $kp(x)$ is reducible in $K$, *i.e.*, $kp(x) = f(x)\cdot g(x)$ for some $f,g \in \mathcal{P}^n_{K}$ [the set of all polynomials of degree $< n$ over $K$]. This implies that $p(x) = (k^{-1}f(x))\cdot g(x)$, since $k^{-1} \in K$.  
This means that $p(x)$ is reducible, which is a contradiction. Hence $kp(x)$ is irreducible over $K$.  
(ii) $kp(x)$ is irreducible over $K \Rightarrow p(x)$ is irreducible over $K$.  
Suppose $p(x)$ is reducible in $K$, *i.e.*, $p(x) = f(x)\cdot g(x)$ for some $f,g \in \mathcal{P}^n_{K}$. This implies that $kp(x) = (kf(x))\cdot g(x)$, since $k \in K$.  
This means that $kp(x)$ is reducible, which is a contradiction. Hence $p(x)$ is irreducible over $K$.  

**Note.** The set of all polynomials of degree $<n$ over a Galois field $GF(p)$ is denoted as $GF(p^n)$, and is called an *extended Galois field*.

## Polynomial Division
Just like integers, polynomials over a ring can also be divided, and Euclid's Division Lemma applies to them as well. *i.e.*, given any two polynomials $g(x), r(x) \in K[X]$, there exist unique $q(x), r(x) \in K[X]$ such that
<div>
$$
g(x) = q(x)f(x) + r(x),
$$
</div>
and $0 \leq$ deg $r <$ deg $g$. Given this, we can apply Euclid's Algorithm and Euclid's Extended Algorithm to polynomials over $K$, and thus find their greatest common divisors and inverses.

### Euclid's Algorithm
Euclid's Algorithm for polynomials is exactly analogous to Euclid's Algorithm for integers:  
gcd$(a(x),b(x))$  
1. $A(x) = a(x)$, $B = b(x)$  
2. if $(B(x) == 0)$ then return A(x)  
3. $R(x) = A(x)$ mod $B(x)$  
4. $A(x) = B(x)$, $B(x) = R(x)$  
5. return gcd$(A(x),B(x))$

### Euclid's Extended Algorithm
Again, Euclid's Extended Algorithm for polynomials is exactly analogous to Euclid's Extended Algorithm for integers:  
inverse$(a(x),b(x))$  
1. $A_1(x) = 1, A_2(x) = 0, A_3(x) = b(x)$ and $B_1(x) = 0, B_2(x) = 1, B_3(x) = a(x)$  
2. if $(B_3(x) == 0)$ then return error  
3. if $(B_3(x) == 1)$ then return $B_2(x)$  
4. $Q(x) = \lfloor\frac{A_3(x)}{B_3(x)}\rfloor$  
5. $R_1(x) = A_1(x) - Q(x)B_1(x), R_2(x) = A_2(x) - Q(x)B_2(x), R_3(x) = A_3(x) - Q(x)B_3(x)$  
6. $A_1(x) = B_1(x), A_2(x) = B_2(x), A_3(x) = B_3(x)$  
7. $B_1(x) = R_1(x), B_2(x) = R_2(x), B_3(x) = R_3(x)$  
8. return inverse($A_3(x),B_3(x)$)
