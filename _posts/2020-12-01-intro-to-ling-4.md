There exist multiple media for communication, however we do not call all of them a 'language'. What then is a language?

## Hockett's Features of Language
Charles F Hockett in the 1960's defined what he believed were the ["features of language"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockett%27s_design_features). Some of them include:

### Arbitrarines
The symbols used to connect the signifier (word) and the signified (objects, concepts) are arbitrary, there is no logical connection between the two. eg: tree, vriksha, pedh.
Onomatopoeic words form the exception, since they are formed such that they imitate the sound they represent.

### Semanticity/Discreteness
Different entities have different names and ways to refer to them. Consider the distinction between 'chair' and 'stool', very similar objects, with a small difference.

### Duality of pattern/Double articulation
Languages organise and combine sounds and arrange words in set ways. The small number of individually meaningless atoms come together to form larger meaningful symbols.
From a finite set of such atoms, we can create and indefinitely large number of objects.

Human beings are also capable of reacting differently to the same stimulus. For e.g., if a group visits the Louvre to see the Mona Lisa, they may all react slightly differently.
